  "welcome" : "
Thank you for installing the mod! I'm constantly working on improvements, but since I'm only one person, updates will be slow.

I added this so that people who have other mods that use ZB or have ZB as a standalone mod can more easily see changes.

^cyan;ATTN: Steam Workshop Users^reset;
While technically the Steam workshop page can be used for reporting issues, please note that Steam doesn't provide an active notification system for me to see updates regularly; I HIGHLY recommend using the ^green;GitHub^reset; page to report issues instead, as I can receive priority notifications that way. You can report mod issues on the GitHub page at https://github.com/VantaSB/vanta-race/issues",
