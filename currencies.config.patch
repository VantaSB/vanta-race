// SAIL currency list parameters:
//	sail_secret		- Set to 'true' if this currency should be displayed only if the player has the currency (more than 0)
//	sail_hidden		- Set to 'true' if this currency should not be displayed in the currency list (overrides 'sail_secret', so no point in defining them both)
//	sail_group		- A string for grouping resources together (because 'pairs' is not organized)
//						If no group is defined, the resource defaults to 'unsorted'
//						Their strings are defined in '\zb\newSail\data.config' inside the 'TextData.currencies' table
//	sail_group_order	- Defined only in 'money'(aka pixels), and used to order the groups. Not patching defined groups into this will result in random orders for those groups
//						'main' should not be on the list because it is added manually via script, and is always first (I suggest against touching their 'sail_group' value as well)
//						'unsorted' should not be on the list because it is added manually via script, and is always last
