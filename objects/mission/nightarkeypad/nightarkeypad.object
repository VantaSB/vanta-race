/*

Yoinked from base game assets and expanded to be used beyond bounty quests. There are additional properties below that can be configured through admin spawning/Tiled:

"interval" = Seen with momentary switches; adjusts the timer function before switching off.
"persistent" = Disables the timer and tells the script to remain 'on'.

"combination" = This was carried over from the original incarnation, but this can now be configured in Tiled.

The script pane has been modified to auto-close after the correct combination is received, and the keypad will disable interacivity while 'on'. If 'persistent' is 'true', the keypad will permanently disable interactivity until it is forcibly removed from the world (this option should only be used in instance worlds/dungeons).
