    "As with any other society, we have gone through the throes of a 'primitive' era, last known to us some five millennia ago. However, we lack definitive accounts from that time, so not much is known about our complete history before our Imperial Era. Our homeworld, where the first Nightars hailed from, was a world of unyielding darkness. The sun itself gave off little light, though somehow it also gave off enough heat to keep the life on the planets around it alive.",

    "For the longest time, all we knew was a life of darkness. To walk safely in the light was seen as a slight against our very species, thus did we elect to free ourselves from our dogmatic chains that bound us to such idiocy. At first, many of us were put down on the spot, but as time marched on, we began to amass more and more, until eventually a civil war broke out. This war would drag on for centuries, if not for an entire millennium.",

    "As we became more aware of our own inner workings, we sought to maximize our potential in that time. We embraced the light, for it did not ail us as it did our Nightar brethren. Thus, we began to walk the path of both light and dark. Many lives were lost during those horrible years for both sides, innocent blood spilled over what was seen as a personal afront to some. But we pressed on, eager to break free of our unseen shackles.",

    "Eventually, the war came to a stalemate, and I agreed to a summons with the Imperial generals. The proposal offered by them was laughable - we were to lay down our arms and surrender peacefully, and agree to be relocated to further depths below them. How arrogant to assume we would simply let them tower over us.",

    "I counter-proposed that we would take our leave of the planet if they agreed to provide the transportation, so as not to lose any of their fleet. They deliberated on this for quite some time before finally agreeing to it, though I sensed that they would rather have seen us under their feet.\n\n-Kyrilu Marek, 26th Remschied Tribe Chronicler"
