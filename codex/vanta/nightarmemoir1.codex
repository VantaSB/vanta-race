    "\"Bear witness to the testimony of ^cyan;Cian Athanasi, the Banished One^reset;.\n\nIn my final days as a faithful servant of the Dusk Father, our Emperor, I made a foolish decision to hear the pleas of one of the light-tainted. In hearing his words, I could not help but feel sympathy for this man we imprisoned, and went to plea for forgiveness on his behalf to His Emminence, Elder Mirche. My pleas fell on deaf ears, however, and not only was the prisoner immediately executed, but then I too was put to trial, accused of having been tainted by the light's influence.",

    "Thus, was I stripped of my Identity, and cast out to wander the lands beyond the safety of the city I was born to. Though I will have long departed this plane's physical existence, all I can do is write this memoir, and hope that someone may understand the seriousness of my crime in Nightar society: a Nightar must not fall to light's dastardly whispers, or else they will lose everything that makes them who they are. Though I have found solace in my exile and found kindred spirits in my travels, my soul may never find rest in the Dusk Halls."
