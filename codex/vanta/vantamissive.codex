    "My child, I write this for you in the hopes that no matter how much light and darkness encroah upon you, you will find balance between both. The task I give you is daunting, and will have you put your own life in peril at times, but still, I must ask too much of you. The fate of our universe hangs in the balance, our race alongside many others caught in the middle of an oncoming storm.",

    "From our ruined homeworld did a prophet come, bringing with him a grave warning of a ^orange;voidborne death^reset; that hungers for all life throughout the stars. To ready ourselves for this oncoming threat, he has brought to us lost knowledge, and the means by which to prepare ourselves over time.",

    "Though we have not reached the stage of our being as we once were, we find ourselves ready to face not only the ^ornage;voidborn death^reset;, but also against our former brothers and sisters who had given themselves over to barbarism, as well as those who seek to subjugate us from across the stars.",

    "As we begin to step back into the galactic stage with the banner of friendship to the rest of the universe, I must ask that you continue to hone your skills and seek out any and all relics from our history that you can. We send you not only as our proudest warrior, but as our forerunner to our potential stellar brethren.",

    "Let them witness your heroic deeds, and build their faith in our race once more, that we may continue to thrive alongside them. May the light bear you to safety, and may the shadows cloud the sight of any enemies who would do you harm, for it is within you that we place our highest hopes.\n\n-Sionann Zima, Zan'ei matriarch"
