    "We boarded the vessels they arranged for us, almost demanding we surrender any weapons we have. They presumed much in thinking we would just go quietly. No, we held fast to our weapons in case there was treachery to be had. It wasn't long until after we were within distance of our destination that we realized our fears would eventually come to pass. Mutiny broke out, due to constant harassment from the crew, and eventually, the ship veered off of its landing path and crashed into the planet's surface.",

    "All of us and the crew themselves were fortunate enough to survive, though we gave them no quarter once we regrouped. After some of the engineers reported the damage to the leaders, they came to realize that no help would be coming any time soon, as the circumstances leading up to the crash had the stench of sabotage. Disheartened by this, I offered a proposal.",

    "We were not so heartless as our ancestors to immediately shun them, and we offered the crew an ultimatum as thus: they would be granted sanctuary with us, treated as equals with their own voices, not beholden to mindlessly agree with other proposals carried out, in exchange for helping us establish a settlement for all of us, or they could choose not to help and be given supplies and materials evenly divided from the crash to build their own settlement, as long as they didn't interfere with ours.",

    "The look on the admiral's face brought a feeling of joy that I hadn't felt in years, not because I forced him into a corner, but because I believe that this was genuinely his first instance of experiencing 'mercy'. His agreement to help was a welcome endorsement to my ears, and from that day forward, we were all Vanta.\n\n-Kyrilu Marek, 26th Remschied Tribe Chronicler"
