    "It's often said that the reason Vanta are not considered \"true Nightars\" is because of our cultural differences. Nightarian warriors take the utmost pride in wielding strictly blades, and thus shun the use of firearms in any fashion (obviously, this excludes crossbows). While the Vanta have yet to embrace some of the more diverse aspects of them, they have a rather unique take on firearms:\n\n^orange;The gunblade^reset;",

    "From hearing the name of it, most people would believe that a gunblade is simply a gun with a blade attached to it, allowing you to simultaneously wield gun and sword at once. These types of iterations, if any exist, are paltry imitations of what the Vanta consider a gunblade to actually be. A gunblade, as employed by the Vanta, are still primarily martial weapons, requiring a unique skill to wield them.",

    "The designs of the gunblade have a triggering mechanism, yes; but rather than fire a bullet, the mechanism simply creates a combustion. The intricate design allows for the blade to absorb and focus the vibrations from that, creating a sort of harmonic resonance for only a brief moment. When pitted against other weapons, it has been known to shatter them outright, rendering the opponent without weapons and defenses."
