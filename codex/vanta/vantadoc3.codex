    "Much like the Nightars, the Vanta truly thrive in dark, shadowy environments. However, unlike their evolutionary predecessors, while they still have to contend with the myriad beasts lurking in shadow, they do not fear the dark, but embrace it all the more. They do fear, however, the beasts that are often spoken of in Nightar lore, as some Vanta claim to have come into contact with such creatures.",

    "I've often tried to imagine what sort of monster could possess such a level of intelligence that would skulk around in the shadows, able to discern who was the weakest. I doubt any other race would have such a tenacity that the Vanta and Nightars both seem to possess. This creature, lacking any discernable name in our own databases, was very translucent in nature, easily missable to the naked eye if not for the subtle shifts in low-light environments.",

    "After they slew many of these creatures, the Vanta were able to dissect and learn a great deal for them. Countless hours of research were poured into discovering its inner workings, and they learned that while it wasn't particularly strong, it was intelligent enough to know where to strike on the body where it counted. They learned so much from its biology that they were able to create an active personnel cloaking implant to use for themselves.",

    "To think that the successors of the infamous Nightars would further master the shadows by hunting their most dangerous hunter; they have truly embraced and mastered the darkness."
