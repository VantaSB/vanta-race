    "For thousands of years did the Nightars reign in peace, until technology began to permeate our society. Seeing that technology enhanced our combat skills overall, we began improving drastically, to the point where we could travel through the stars with ease. This new spacefaring era raised concerns within the Conclave about how to maintain rule over the Nightars from afar.",

    "In light of this, the Emperor forbade all off-world travel and ordered any and all vessels capable of breaking beyond our skies dismantled. This was seen as fear, and it was during that time tensions were already rising, due to a new generation of Nightars emerging who had grown out of their weakness to the light. Then one day, our empire became consumed by war in an instant.",

    "Having sensed this fear, several of these new Nightars challenged the legitimacy of the Emperor's throne, and in doing so, were swiftly put to the blade. This sparked a grand war, and over time, the 'daywalkers' began to grow exponentially. Our society was fractured in half between old and new; brother fought sister, father fought son, elders fought young. It was a terrible, dark time for us all.",

    "Eventually, the stress of war took its toll on the royal family, and the Emperor passed away. It will be said that for many years afterwards, a fight for the seat will continue on for some time. We no longer associate ourselves with our once-beloved brethren, for they would rather see us all exiled or executed for not fearing the light as they do. I pray that one day we shall set aside this single difference and reunite Nightars with Vanta.\n\n-Sionann Zima, 8th Queenbreaker General"
