    "To understand the Vanta, you first have to understand their progenitors, the Nightar. From a biological standpoint, the Vanta's only distinction from the Nightar is that they have not inherited their weakness to natural light. The Vanta still prefer living in shadows, but they do not suffer anywhere near as much, if at all, from being exposed to natural light as the Nightar do.",

    "From this, we can conclude that the Vanta are a fairly recent evolutionary branch of the Nightar race. Culturally speaking, the Nightar are still mired in tradition and very brutal rites of passage akin to what you would see in the early history of the humans' medieval period, and similar activities from current Floran culture. The key difference here, however, is that while the Nightar shun the light and embrace the darkness, the Vanta walk the path of both, giving them a slight edge over their biological predecessors.",

    "They also still maintain a stance of privacy, but are still considerably more social than the Nightar overall. The Vanta have also adapted to ranged weaponry, breaking off from the dogmatic traditions of Nightar martial combat training. This, of course, has earned them the ire of the Nightar society at-large, and the Vanta have been disavowed as \"true\" Nightar."
