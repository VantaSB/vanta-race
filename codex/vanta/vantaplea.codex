    "It is with regret that I write this final testament. I am Kyrilu Marek, last Architectus Scientia of the Old Vanta Empire. Disaster has come to our homeworld before I could finish my work. My final machines, built to heal the air and soil of our world, were destroyed by a new empire established in the darkness of the wastelands, calling themselves ^red;Nightar^reset;. I have no way to defend myself from their oncoming assault; fleeing would only drive them to pursue me to no end. The safety of the young prophet is my highest concern; I have no choice but to stand my ground while he flees to safety. With him, I send all of my records in an escape vessel that can outmaneuver their current weapons, in the hopes they both find sanctuary. I speak to you from beyond the grave, to plead to you... Steel yourselves for the coming ^ornage;scourge born from the void^reset;, and against those of us who would see your destruction. Lift the veil of hatred from the eyes of our people; seek out our knowledge and remaining relics, that they may serve you well in your struggles."
