    "For a while, I was granted leave to stay among the Nightars, and among the Vanta, taking care not to upset either's establishments. This record details a bit more about their societal structures.",

    "The Nightars have remained a very imperialistic society ever since they were first recorded. They are so expansive, that even large settlements still answer to an even larger, over-arching \"homeworld\" that we still have yet to discern the whereabouts of.",

    "The non-homeworld settlements do have some autonomy, effectively a self-contained stratocracy; military leaders have the final say-so when it comes to local sector laws for their establishment, and even vary from settlement to settlement.",

    "The Vanta have maintained a similar structure, only there's no over-arching homeworld; each Vanta settlement is completely autonomous compared to the Nightars by far. In a strange sort of way, Vanta settlements are collectively a confederacy of sorts."
