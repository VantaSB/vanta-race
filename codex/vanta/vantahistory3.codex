    "How arrogant they are to believe we will continue to suffer their indoctrinations. Are we not warriors of the same blood? Are we not worthy of carrying our mantle? The clergymen believe not, for as Nightars are of the darkness, they also fear it, yet we do not. It is nothing short of astounding how quickly your own kin will turn on you the instant they notice something different about you. But I'm not the only one who tires of this loathsome dogma, no.",

    "What has it profited them to drive us out as lepers? They have paid their wages in blood, as have we. This war, while I have never condoned it, will be a standing testament that the Nightar Empire is inept; others will see these events recorded in history and say \"what primitive creatures they are, preying upon each other.\" The time will come when the dust has settled, and even outsiders will know the truth, no matter how much the Conclave will try to hide it.",

    "We sought to make amends, but they would rather we banish ourselves to further depths than the ground upon which they tread. Damn them all - we will not be hidden away in shame! I'll not stand for such an afront. Where words fail in the battlefield, our steel will speak for us. On this, I have sworn to see our freedom.\n\n-Sionann Zima, 8th Queenbreaker General"
