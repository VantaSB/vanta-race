		"    As with any other society, we have gone through the throes of a 'primitive' era, last known to us some millennia ago. We lack a number of definitive accounts from that time, however, so not much is known about our complete history from before our Imperial era. I will attempt to recollect what IS known here. Our homeworld was a world of unyielding darkness. While the light of our star was dim in comparison to others that sustained life, the heat was enough to keep life on our planet alive.\n\n    For millennia, all we knew was a life of dwelling in shadows. To walk safely in the light was unheard of and was something many would consider a 'pipe dream', as those of the common tongue would say. To other societies beyond our star, this is what earned us the title ^cyan;Knights of the Night^reset;, eventually becoming known as the ^orange;Nightar^reset;. Over time, as we became more aware of our own inner workings, we began to use darkness to our advantage. The beasts who often held the upper hand in hunting us became the prey, as did many other beings. We honed our battlecraft and created more sophisticated weapons with this newfound courage.\n\n    It was around this time the first traces of our societies began to emerge. One day, a particularly ravenous beast began to terrorize the region in which we lived, laying waste to anything and everything it could. While many of us cowered before the beast's might, one brave soul stepped forth, clad in armor of his own making, and slew the beast after a long battle. Though we all knew him since his day of birth, we knew not his techniques - he was able to manipulate the energy that permeated our planet and use it as both a weapon and a shield.\n\n    After the battle, we beseeched the man to teach us all his techniques and these arcane arts. He was more than happy to share his knowledge with us, and he was heralded as a hero. Under his tutelage, we created even more sophisticated weaponry and artifacts with which to harness the energy around us like he did, creating even more potent magicks. After only a few years, our society now thrived, we faced a new problem - more and more settlements began to arise, and the regional governors were squabbling amongst themselves as to who had more right to lead everyone.",

		"    During a gathering to discuss how to handle this problem, one of the governors put forth an interesting idea. To our surprise, he was willing to serve under a central figurehead that oversaw all of us. Each settlement would dedicate their armies to this centralized authority, both to maintain day-to-day peace and organize us for war, if it ever came to it. The other governors and elders agreed, as did many of the citizens, myself included. When it came time to choose who would lead us, our eyes turned to the man who saved us and taught us everything we know now.\n\n    Initially, the man was reluctant to accept such a nomination, though none could blame him for it. However, after much time to consider, he nonetheless accepted his role as our ruler. With guidance from our elders and keeping his ears to the please of our citizens, our society greatly flourished and he maintained a peaceful reign, having been cultivated as our first emperor. By his reign, he set the standard for rulers to come after him, and even in times of uncertainty concerning appointed heirs, we maintained peace throughout our society.\n\n    When we began to embrace more scientific and technological endeavors, a curious phenomenon began to take place. The light of our star grew brighter on our planet, piercing the veil of shadows as our atmosphere began to cleanse, and we discovered that we had a natural weakness to its light. At large, the sun's direct light seared flesh, and rendered many to ash within moments. Our society was under threat by nature once more, and for a time, we were required to withdraw into the depths of the planet.\n\n    Our scientific minds of the time had deduced that because we were born of and lived in the shadows, we were destined to remain in them. We devised a means of creating an artificial shade to encapsulate our cities, working by night to accomplish the feat. Over time, however, we discovered that some of us were either not affected by or affected as much by the light of the sun, which prompted an investigation. Our emperor had requested that these individuals come forth to present themselves of their own volition so that we could ascertain why.",

		"    Many individuals came forward, unsure of what would happen to them. However, our emperors were always kind and understanding, and allayed their fears and uncertainty by promising that these examinations would be completely voluntary if they chose to provide themselves, and would ensure no repercussions would be visited upon them if they refused. Our scientific leaders also bade us to proceed with extreme care so as not to cause irreparable harm to those who volunteered.\n\n    Through intense study, we were able to isolate several factors that allowed these individuals to survive direct sunlight with little to no harm, and we worked tirelessly to replicate these effects onto others. It should be stressed that while some of these processes were deemed inhumane, we took the time to carefully warn of the potential dangers, up to and including death. Those who had lost their lives during this trial process were given spots in the royal tombs as a testament to how much our emperor honored their bravery.\n\n    When it seemed we had exhausted all of our methods, we chanced upon several individuals who began to exhibit signs of adaptation to the processes and treatments. We studied the results carefully, noting all physical and mental traits before finally allowing them to see the outside again. Each of them survived a full day in the sun with nearly no side effects, and showed no signs of long-lasting physical or mental trauma. We marveled at our labors, and these individuals were heralded as heroes in their own rights.\n\n    No longer were we confined to the shadows - we could safely travel the planet at any time of the day, and even look towards exploring beyond our skies to other planets, which would indeed come after some time. We still thrived in the shadows, and so we kept our epithet as 'Knights of the Night,' but our homeworld eventually became a paradise for all to enjoy. Not all shared in it, however, and over time, dissent would slowly begin to permeate through our society, but for the time being, we were happy to be able to undertake grander and grander endeavors.\n\n- Kirylu Marek, 26th Remschied Chronicler"
