    "    The great machina we created performed flawlessly, absorbing the pollution from the air and soil. However, they also betrayed our hidden location to our enemies, the bright lights in the skies roused an old hatred in the hearts of the tribalists, beckoning them to action, as they had felt threatened by the presence of our machines. We were marked for death. They had crafted new magicks to protect their warriors and sent them into the charred wastelands to hunt what scientists remained. Though we tried to avoid conflict, many of us were found and executed by tribalist warriors. I am the last Architectus Scientia, sole survivor of the hunting raids of the tribalists.

    In order to protect myself, I reflected upon the wisdom of the starborne traveller; I had constructed stone sentinels and placed them outside the walls of my home, ever watchful to protect me from my enemeies. Forgotten in exile, now a creature of myth to the tribalists, I worked tirelessly to protect myself and what remained of our world. I crafted magicks and machina in an attempt to breathe life back into the wastelands, finding a new source of energy which I would come to call ^blue;ceruleum^reset;. I swore an oath to atone for the devastation inflicted upon our world, aided by my hands, caused by blind pursuit of science and war.

    And yet, while I toiled endlessly to heal the lands, the tribalists began to exhibit peculiarities; some continued to slip into barbarism, others began embracing science while combining it with their powerful magicks, and some simply regressed into mere shadows of their former selves, not just in mind, but in form as well. These new forms, these shades, were as docile as an unmoving boulder, seeking only to wander aimlessly, yet fleeing from any form of perceived conflict. The barbarians, with no more of us to hunt, began to turn on each other, their magicks lost to them, becoming as the savage predators of the wild.

    I have grown old; even with the powers of my magic and science, I cannot cheat death forever. I would need a successor to carry on my task of healing the lands, though I know my chances of finding one are marginal, at best. As I began to feel my efforts being in vain, I chanced upon a young tribalist wondering the wastelands and rescued him. It would turn out that this was not by mere luck, however. He was tirelessly searching for ^orange;the last Architectus Scientia^reset; to tell of his visions.

    In his dreams, he saw planets where some of us had settled upon, many of them having similar or worse fates from raging wars. But he also spoke of a voidborne death coming to a ^ornage;small, blue world^reset;, which would eventually turn to the rest of the universe, and with his vision came a plea to spread his vision and my knowledge to the stars. My ambition renewed, I set out to record testaments of our history, sciences and magicks to spread to the universe, in the hope that our knowledge would aid any who were brave enough to take on this dangerous, new task of universal salvation."
