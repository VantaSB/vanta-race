    "    We Vanta, having descended from the Nightar, were given the task of maintaining a balance between our old and new ways, in accordance with the prophecy given to us by the ^orange;traveller from the stars^reset;. Our old ways can be best described as ^red;discipleship of combat^reset;, our battlecraft honed to a degree many would consider terrifying. Our new ways are the ^blue;discipleship of knowledge^reset;, where our scientific minds pursue knowledge and wisdom above all else. Even in our combat arts, maintaining a steady balance is no easy task, and so we devised a means of recognizing when newer disciples have achieved a certain level of mastery of what we call ^orange;The Threefold Path^reset;. Through discipleship of knowledge, we hone our scientific expertise not just for combat capabilities, but overall self-improvement. All of these details will be elaborated upon in this manuscript.",

		"^cyan;DISCIPLESHIP OF COMBAT^reset;\n\n    As previously noted, the Threefold Path is designed to achieve mastery across the various styles of combat in conjunction with maintaining the knowledge and wisdom in various techniques. Through our science and arcane knowledge, we were able to craft weapons and armor reflective of specializations at every level. The three specializations are the paths of ^#d1e160;the Adept^reset;, ^#a8e6e2;the Forerunner^reset;, and ^#d29ce7;the Sentinel^reset;; attaining mastery in these specializations allows one to grow and attain greater strength and wisdom.\n\n    The other races throughout the universe have utilized various types of ore and materials to produce weapons and armor, and so do we. However, up until recently, there are some materials that only we were able to utilize due to our nature. Initially, it was believed that they were unique to worlds where we thrived, but after years of starfaring and observation, we came to discover that all planets were seeded with these ^orange;dark fragments^reset;. To date, we still do not understand the how or why of this matter, but we would like to believe that this was to help us achieve our mightiest forms, and to teach others how to utilize them as well.",

		"^#d1e160;THE PATH OF THE ADEPT^reset;\n\n    Adepts typically find themselves supporting their allies from a distance and are typically found using a wide variety of ranged weapons, including bows, firearms, and magick-like implements. If applied properly, an Adept is capable of bringing great devastation to an enemy, though they tend not to enjoy the raw strength of Vanguards, nor the defense of Sentinels, making them specialists of reserved expertise rather than outright assault.\n\n\n^#a8e6e2;THE PATH OF THE FORERUNNER^reset;\n\n    Forerunners boast great strength and are the first to charge into enemy strongholds and are much more versatile in terms of weapons and utilities. Of the three paths, Forerunners exhibit the closest resemblance to our old ways with their brute strength, and their ability to bring out the most of ranged or melee combat is a testament to their survival instincts.\n\n\n^#d29ce7;THE PATH OF THE SENTINEL^reset;\n\n    Sentinels are unique in their own right, as though they don't typically bear the raw strength of Forerunners or the high energy of Adepts, Sentinels excel in defensive maneuvers and melee combat, often repelling an enemy siege and providing cover for their allies. Their equipment is typically composed of denser concentrations of metals, designed to withstand sgnificant amounts of damage at the expense of range and movability.",

		"^cyan;DISCIPLESHIP OF KNOWLEDGE^reset;\n\n    Through our pursuit of knowledge, we not only increased our combat capabilities, but our survivability in various environments. When new disciples set out on their journeys, we equip them with a research table to invest in their crafts, and achieve pinnacle strength and wisdom. This can range from minor increases in their combat capabilities or completely new inventions and reinventions, making them an overall versatile warrior.\n\n    We know not of when the ^orange;voidborne death^reset; will be heralded into the universe, but the traveller's words are the keystone for our great work. We hope that you will, in turn, take our words to heart - make them the foundation of your discipline, and if the time ever comes, you will surely be ready."
