		"    Our homeworld, ^orange;Sovion^reset;, as it is called in the common tongue, was a world we considered to be paradise unrivaled. Songs of joy filled the streets of the imperial capitol, and all people, whether they were highborne or lowborne, were honored according to their merit. When the ways of science began to grow, we celebrated in joy as we walked among the light and launched our first vessels to the stars.\n\n    In our forays into the unknown of the vastness of space, we found stellar brethren in many of the various races scattered throughout. New knowledge came to us, and we gladly shared what we knew with our new friends in return. All of us were filled with pride, and our old ways began to fade. Yet, in silence, cries of rage echoed from those who mourned the loss of our primal traditions.\n\n    Our myriad scientific work was not enough to sate those who held the old ways in their hearts, as they believed we were destined to forever dwell in shadows as our ancestors had. The Nightar of eld were confined to the darkest shadows of space, as any light from a star would be enough to cause them to turn to ash within mere moments.\n\n    In the midst of trying to reconcile our new and old ways, we were visited by a ^orange;traveller from the stars^reset;. In the traveller's presence, we could feel a countenance like none other, as if this mysterious visitor were ordained to convey the very will of the universe itself. The traveller brought us a dire warning. A ^orange;voidborne death^reset; loomed in the days to come. It would first claim a small, blue world before turning its sights to the rest of the universe.",

		"    As the traveler spoke these words, we could feel the urgency behind them. We were urged to find a way to reconcile our old and new ways with expediency, and so began our great work. A great many of us, both disciples of combat and disciples of knowledge, worked tirelessly to maintain a balance. There were many, however, from both schools that did not want to acknowledge the other. Some took extreme measures to try and maintain what they believed to be the correct, sole path, and these incidents began to increase in number by the day.\n\n    Having also heeded the traveler's words, the imperial family also urged everyone to work towards maintaining the balance between old and new, as it was essential to combatting the ^orange;voidborne death^reset; spoken about, per the traveller's own words. This worked to quell dissenters for a time, but would not last as long as we'd hoped. Conspirators among the dissenters worked in secret to completely uproot our progress and return us to the old ways by sword and flame.\n\n    At first, these began as small skirmishes, but as diplomacy eroded into depravity, our peaceful society became embroiled in a bloody civil war. Those who had embraced science turned from exploration to devastation, slandering those who clung to the old ways - their tribal enemies unleashed their swords and the darkest of our ancient magicks upon them in retaliation, cursing all who embraced the new ways.\n\n    We know not what became of the imperial family; it is said that they may have escaped, but nobody could find traces of where they had gone if they did. What is known, however, is that a conspirator among them helped bring about this age of war. The sins of all who had a hand in this, myself included, have stained us and our children for generations to come.",

		"    Our homeworld was waylaid by barbarism, arcane nightmares, and hellish science, forver scorching our once beautiful and bountiful fields, wracked by darkest war. Endless black smoke filled the skies and shrouded our world in darkness once again, the soil becoming soaked with the toxins of pollution with only small regions remaining habitable. Those of us who tired of war readied our ships and departed, leaving behind a charred husk secluded in the vastness of the stars.\n\n    Our bodies battered and spirits broken, we spread our lot among many distant worlds. In time, some of us began to slowly rebuild our society to preserve our ways, both old and new, while others opted to integrate with other societies. Those of us who set upon rebuilding came to learn years later that our homeworld still remained, and even more curiously, that those who once castigated the ways of science now embraced it.\n\n    I thought I had gone mad upon hearing this, but after being shown the proof, I was at first excited, and then a horrible realization quickly set in. The former tribalists did not embrace science for the sake of maintaining balance as we were commanded, but began doing so for the sake of conquest. Whoever was left of the royal family now hungered for the bounty of the rest of the universe, and sought to overtake all else. This rekindled something in all of us who fled, a newfound sense of duty now compels us to continue what we started.\n\n    We can only hope that our efforts will make way for the generations after us. From this point forward, we were no longer Nightar, but embraced a new moniker. As knights of the night, keepers of darkest shadows, we embraced a term invented by the common tongue to describe us: henceforth, we are now known as the ^orange;Vanta^reset;.\n\n- Kirylu Marek, 26th Remschied Chronicler"
