Metaphorically speaking, of course." ],

Let's make some more augments! NO, WAIT... LET'S MAKE AUGMENTABLE ARMORS INSTEAD! What's that? Why only the tier 6 armor sets? Because while augmenting everything may SEEM like fun, it would ultimately break game balance. OH SHIT, WE BROKE THE FOURTH WALL, IGNORE THIS." ]
