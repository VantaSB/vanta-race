			"basic"	: [ "Basic Knowledge",			"You've started on your journey, having narrowly escaped a fate worse than death. You've learned more about yourself from your ordeal, and what really makes you what you are. You now begin to research the myriad truths of your existence, and have begun to research into the forbidden technologies and arts that the Nightars have kept hidden. The few notes you have point you towards looking into \"Dark Fragments\", which are shown to be nearly all over the universe in various quantities." ],

			"vantamani"	: [ "Manipulator Technology",			"Having grasped the fundamentals of the Matter Manipulator, you've come to understand its inner workings and its usefulness. However, you also still have that deep-rooted sense of superiority. Rather than abandon the device outright, you seek to improve upon it and have created a schematic that greatly improves upon its design. All you need is a sufficient power source and the materials to handle it properly." ],

      "vantaspec1" : [ "Vanta Spec I",			"Having collected a large enough sampling size of Dark Fragments, at first glance you realize that these are largely overlooked by other species as pretty, jet-black gemstones. However, only through the eyes of a Nightar, and also a Vanta like yourself, is their true value revealed. You sense a special type of energy within that you can surely put to use." ],

      "vantaspec2" : [ "Vanta Spec II",				"Your research into the Dark Fragments has led to the discovery that the energy contained within them can act as a catalyst of sorts to other metals. At various stages, and with the proper amount of catalyizing material, the metals can be turned into the famed \"Nightsteel\" that are used to produce Nightarian armor and weapons." ],

      "vantaspec3" : [ "Vanta Spec III",			"The Dark Fragments seem to almost be speaking to you at this point. You conduct your symphony of research with promising results, and have gained further insight into how the fragments work. Initially, they had to be cracked open to make use of the energy contained within, but you've discovered that combining the fragments as they are, along with their catalyst forms, into a single object creates the coveted Dark Crystals, which brim with power. Creating these crystals has piqued your curiosity into making specialty weapons and equipment, and you continue you research." ],

			"vantatech1c" : [ "DS Compression - Mk.II",			"While researching, Elliott pondered the overall usefulness of the various sphere techs in practice, and has decided that of all things to combine, your own nano sphere and the Spike Sphere are suitable candidates for a new, omni-centric approach. Elliott once more has sent you some schematics to craft this marvel of sphere tech, which you are all too delighted to try out.\n\n^red;(Overwrites Vanta Nano Sphere)" ],

			"vantatech2a" : [ "Personnel Cloaking - Mk.I",			"Some monsters are able to phase-shift, rendering them temporarily invulnerable to all forms of attack, and even allowing them to pass through solid matter. Having sifted through research upon reearch upon research, you've concluded that you would never be able to adapt any piece of technology to allow you to do either. However, you did manage to achieve a breakthrough: rather than rendering yourself invulnerable or being able to phase through walls, you were able to render yourself invisible to the naked eye. The downside is that you have to force yourself to walk in order not to break the field accidentally." ],

			"vantatech2b" : [ "Personnel Cloaking - Mk.II",			"Combining your research with Elliott's, and allowing her to observe your techniques, she has stolen away back to her lab with comprehensive data and has begun working on a new stealth module with more stability than your previous one. Being able to run while stealthed comes in handy, eh?\n\n^red;(Overwrites Previous Stealth Tech)" ],

			//"vantatech2c" : [ "Personnel Cloaking - Mk.III",			"Not to be barred by typical limitations of selecting techs, you've furthered your reasearch in tech combination and can now equip multiple techs of the same type. Thanks to your unyielding need to surpass all limits, and subsequently many sleepless nights for Elliott, the daring scientist has perfected your cloaking tech to allow for a sideloaded sprinting option.\n\n^red;(Overwrites Previous Stealth Tech)" ]

			"ceruleum" : ["Applied Sciences - Ceruleum",			"This mysterious liquid, on the surface, appears to be nothing more than that: a mysterious liquid. However, after running it through several spectal analyses and consulting with Elliott on your findings, the Outpost's resident scientist has deduced that its myriad properties can be used to create new materials, as well as enhance certain capabilities, if applied properly. It can be refined into a much more stable fuel than Erchius, and provide even more fuel efficiency.\n\nDisclaimer from Elliott: Long-term effects of usage in FTL engines have not been documented, and any damages, no matter how benign or catastrophic, are solely the responsibility of the user."]
