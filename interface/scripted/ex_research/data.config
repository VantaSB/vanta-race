Click a research on the displayed to center the view on it. Click again to hide the list.\n\n- The third button will center the view on the middle of the tree, or the currently selected research.\n\n- The last button toggles ^orange;low quality mode^reset;. This makes the GUI jump to a position instead of panning to it, or the center button. In addition, dragging/navigating on the the main screen will update only after you release the mouse button.

Rather than being limited to the basic learning of blueprints and whatnot, this has been redesigned to permanently add and modify player statgroups for the character in question, and can also unlock other bonuses. You will also notice that drawn lines behave differently and are not tied to the research items themselves. Researches are clustered; each cluster has a root node with floating text assigned, and have no cost when they become available. The subnodes require ^cyan;skill points^reset;, which can be found through various means. Once a cluster has been completely researched, the next cluster or clusters become available.\n\n^green;There are also hidden clusters that can be unlocked by finding certain items!^reset;" ],
