Rather than being limited to the basic learning of blueprints and whatnot, this one has been designed to add and modify player statgroups permanently for the character in question, and can also unlock other bonuses. You will also notice that there are no lines drawn, but still have a sequential pattern and/or are clustered; this is also a custom modification and is intended behavior.\n\n-\n\nSelect a research by clicking one of the icons on the grid.\nYou can navigate the grid by dragging with the left mouse button.\n\n- The topmost button at the right corner closes the research interface.\n\n- The second button opens a list of research trees to pick from.\n\n- The third button opens a list of non-hidden research options. Click a research on the displayed to center the view on it. Click again to hide the list.\n\n- The fourth button will center the view on the middle of the tree, or the currently selected research.\n\n- The last button toggles ^orange;low quality mode^reset;. This makes the GUI jump to a position instead of panning to it, or the center button. In addition, dragging/navigating on the the main screen will update only after you release the mouse button. It is best to use the search list with this mode enabled." ],
