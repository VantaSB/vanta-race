### Instructions
You can download the zip file and unzip it in the mods folder, or you can download the .pak version and save yourself the trouble!

### Bug Reporting
Use this link for Issue Tracking/reporting: https://github.com/AbsoluteXeroEX/vanta-race/issues
When reporting an issue, PLEASE make sure you provide some details as to what's happening like a copy+paste from your starbound.log file or being as descriptive as possible; simply opening up an issue and saying nothing more than "IT'S BROKEN, FIX IT!!11!1!1!ONE!" will immediately be closed and disregarded as user error. No details, no fix.
