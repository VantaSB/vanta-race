### Instructions
Simply download the zip file and unzip to your Starbound /mods folder!

### Bug Reporting
Use this link for Issue Tracking/reporting: https://github.com/AbsoluteXeroEX/vanta-race/issues
When reporting an issue, PLEASE make sure you provide some details as to what's happening like a copy+paste from your starbound.log file or being as descriptive as possible; simply opening up an issue and saying nothing more than "IT'S BROKEN, FIX IT!!11!1!1!ONE!" will immediately be closed and disregarded as user error. No details, no fix.

### Compatibility
Aside from Frackin' Universe or any mod that uses Ztarbound (since ZB is included with this mod by default), this mod should be compatible with just about everything else (with the exception of the older Nightars mod from the original author).
