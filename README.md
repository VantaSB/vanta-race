# IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ
This is a 'nightly' version of the mod, and not intended for 'production' use. 'Production' use refers to the usage of the mod as the *primary* version. Many assets have been modified/changed to facilitate a closer-to-vanilla aspect with regards to item/quest/upgrade progression for the Vanta race, and will be rolled into the next major 'production' release after thorough testing. I aim to resolve present issues such as the tech quests being available to non-Vanta characters, and instances where this mod deprecates custom intro missions for other race mods. Notes for RC updates will be a condensed list version of the 'production' version. I will be adding compatibility for mods that integrate/use the Ztarbound update window feature. Compatibility with Frackin' Universe in its entirety in the near future is unlikely, due to leftover assets from the old Nightar race mod; I would have to gut or rename entire folders in order to make it compatible, and I'm just one person handling the coding for the time being.

### Instructions
You can download the zip file and unzip it in the mods folder, or you can download the .pak version and save yourself the trouble!

### Bug Reporting
Use this link for Issue Tracking/reporting: https://github.com/AbsoluteXeroEX/vanta-race/issues
When reporting an issue, PLEASE make sure you provide some details as to what's happening like a copy+paste from your starbound.log file or being as descriptive as possible; simply opening up an issue and saying nothing more than "IT'S BROKEN, FIX IT!!11!1!1!ONE!" will immediately be closed and disregarded as user error. No details, no fix.

### Compatibility Notes
- Will NOT work with Frackin' Universe
- Will NOT work with the old Nightar Race mod

As stated above, there are compatibility issues with other race mods that have their own custom intros, and I'm positive it's because of how I handled the post-intro scripting, so I'm working on rectifying this.
