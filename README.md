### Instructions
You can download the zip file and unzip it in the mods folder, or you can download the .pak version and save yourself the trouble!

### Bug Reporting
Use this link for Issue Tracking/reporting: [Issues](https://github.com/VantaSB/vanta-race/issues)
When reporting an issue, PLEASE make sure you provide some details as to what's happening like a copy+paste from your starbound.log file or being as descriptive as possible; simply opening up an issue and saying nothing more than "IT'S BROKEN, FIX IT!!11!1!1!ONE!" will immediately be closed and disregarded as user error. No details, no fix.

### Compatibility Notes
- Will NOT work with Frackin' Universe
- Will NOT work with the old Nightar Race mod

### Contributing
There are two ways to contribute.

First: if you'd like to submit proposed changes, you can fork a copy of this repository to your own account on GitHub, make the changes that way, and then submit a **Pull Request** for review (be sure to review the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/VantaSB/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before creating issues and PRs)

Second: You can buy a cup of coffee using the Ko-fi link below! For the most part, I do all of the mod work on my own, so any little bit of motivation helps, even if it's just a small amount!
