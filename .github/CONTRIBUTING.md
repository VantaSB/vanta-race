Reporting Bugs
--------------

This section serves as a guide to the process of bug reporting for the mod. Issues cannot only be used for developers, but for also tracking enhancements and other tasks. The more detailed your report is, the easier it is for developers to reproduce, confirm, and resolve issues.

### Did you find a bug? :bug:

* Ensure the bug is not coming from another mod
* Check to see if an issue was already reported under the [Issues](https://github.com/VantaSB/vanta-race/issues) tab
* Make sure you have a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free) before proceeding; if you are unable to find an open issue that already addresses the problem, [open a new issue](#submit-a-bug-report)

#### Submit A Bug Report :inbox_tray:

There are several things that go into making a bug report a *good* bug report. Below is a breakdown of a generic issue:

* **Title** - This should give some general insight as to what is wrong.
* **Description** - This should contain greater details of the bug that cannot be explained in the **Title**.
* **Labels** - Labels are colored and titled appropriately to represent the categories they fall into.
* **Milestones** - Developers use these to help group tasks together and quickly evaluate how close the project. deliverable is near completion.
* **Assignees** - Developers who are directly assigned to resolve the issue.
* **Comments** - Allows developers and the issue requester or other users to give feedback on the issue.

#### What are some good details to include in a bug report? :pencil2:

When describing the issue in the **Description** area, please try to provide as much information as possible so that developers can quickly resolve the issue. Some information to keep in mind when compiling your report:

* **List of other mods used in your installation** - Include a list of other mods you might be running. This will help identify whether or not there is a conflict between this mod and another mod, if it exists.
* **Include a copy of your starbound.log file** - The log file is a Godsend! This will help developers determine what the issue is from a technical aspect and has more intricate details than the average user would understand.
* **How to reproduce the issue** - Try to include a quick brief of what actions you took before you encountered the bug.
* **Thorough detailing** - This shouldn't have to be said, but if you open an issue and you give a basic description of "YOUR MOD IS BROKEN, FIX IT!!!!!!!", your issue will be marked as invalid and closed immediately with no comment.
  * You will also possibly be laughed at behind the scenes.

Suggesting Enhancements
-----------------------

### Do you have a suggestion for an enhancement or new content ideas? :bulb:

* Open an issue for the feature addition or changes.
* Ensure that the description clearly states what the addition or changes you want to see are.

Issue Labels
------------

For the most part, you won't have any reason to worry about the **Milestone** or **Assignee** parts of an Issue. The different **Labels** of an issue allow developers to quickly understand the issue and also allows for fast searching and sorting.

:bangbang: Users should be aware of the 'Status' Type **Labels** as these sometimes require feedback :bangbang:
